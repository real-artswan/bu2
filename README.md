Babo Violent 2 Unity clone

This is my try to clone in Unity3D this amazing game: https://github.com/Daivuk/BaboViolent2
The main motivation of this project was learning Unity and possible ability to run on many others (not only Windows) platforms.
It is far from finish but spectator mode works in general.
To look on spectator mode do next:
1. Press "Servers".
2. Change "127.0.0.1" to IP of your server.
3. Press "Start" and you should connect as spectator.
4. Press "Join spectator", menu will disappear and you can look at game, navigate and zoom.
